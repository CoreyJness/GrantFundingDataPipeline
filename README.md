## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- **Corey J Burbio Assessment.ipynb** ‚Äî Main notebook for downloading Excel files using Playwright.
- **Corey J Assessment Folder** ‚Äî Folder location where README, documentation, and Excel files are saved.
- **Burbio Assessment Corey J Spreadsheet** ‚Äî Google Sheets file where data is imported, consolidated, and analyzed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

### üñ•Ô∏è 1. Run the Notebook on Google Colab
- Open Google Colab.
- Upload or open the `Corey J Burbio Assessment.ipynb` notebook.
- Connect to a runtime (go to **Runtime > Connect**).
- Install necessary libraries (Playwright, OpenPyXL, Google APIs) inside the notebook if prompted.
- Run all cells (go to **Runtime > Run All**) or step through them.
- The notebook will scrape and download the Excel files automatically.

### üìÇ 2. Upload the Scraped Excel Files
- After running the notebook, the Excel files will appear in the `Corey J Assessment Folder` inside your Google Drive.
- The sheets are automatically uploaded to the `Burbio Assessment Corey J Spreadsheet`.

### üìù 3. Consolidate and Create the Pivot Table
- Open the Google Apps Script editor (**Extensions > Apps Script**) inside your Google Sheet.
- Run the `consolidateAllSheets()` script:

```javascript
function consolidateAllSheets() {
  // Your Apps Script code here
}
```
---

This script:
- Merges all state tabs into one Master tab.
- Drops the first two rows from each imported sheet (headers).
- Adds a column labeling each row with its state.

The pivot table summarizing total grant funding by state was created manually using Google Sheets' built-in pivot table tool.  
It is saved in the "Pivot" sheet.

## üìä Analysis

After analyzing the data provided by the pipeline, it is easy to identify which states receive the most grant money.  
Additional insights into the specific purposes of these grants would provide even greater value for customers.
